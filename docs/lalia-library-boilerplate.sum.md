## sum() function

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

The summary section should be brief. On a documentation web site, it will be shown on a page that lists summaries for many different API items. On a detail page for a single item, the summary will be shown followed by the remarks section (if any).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
/** @sealed */
export default function sum(inputs: SumInputs): number;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  inputs | [SumInputs](./lalia-library-boilerplate.suminputs.md) | An object containing two numbers to be summed |

<b>Returns:</b>

number

The arithmetic sum of `inputs.a` and `inputs.b`

## Remarks

The main documentation for an API item is separated into a brief "summary" section optionally followed by an `@remarks` block containing additional details.

Unlike the summary, the remarks block may contain lengthy documentation content. The remarks should not restate information from the summary, since the summary section will always be displayed wherever the remarks section appears. Other sections (e.g. an `@example` block) if shown will usually appear after the remarks section.

Code samples can be enclosed in a Markdown code fence:

```ts
function sum(inputs) {
  return inputs.a + inputs.b;
}

```
If you use special symbols and don't want to use a code span, you can escape them using backslashes: {<!-- -->@<!-- -->inheritDoc Button.render<!-- -->}

## Example


```ts
const inputs = { a: 1, b: 2 };

console.log(sum(inputs));

```
